	- Q: What do I do if the program crashes while it is running?
	  A: Close the command line program, and you may re-run the program. If that does not work, close any background application while you run the program.

	  A: Close the program. Open your Task Manager and check if the program appears, if it doesn't appear, then open the program again, if it does appear, right-click on it, click end task and re-run the program.
